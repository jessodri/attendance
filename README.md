# Turning Paper Into Tech

Our team (AJ, Chris, Jess and Richard) were responsible for the assessment feature of the Back2Bikes Attendance App.

The features we worked on can be found mainly in imports/api/assessments and imports/ui/assessment although we also had to add a few changes in folders such as imports/ui/layouts and imports/ui/admin.

## <a id="1"></a>Who is your client?
**[Home](#contents)** 

Our client is a non-profit organisation that is filling a need for bike training and recycling where there are currently very few offerings. Bicycle usage is increasing dramatically, more people are using them for daily transport, and the government is investing money in bike infrastructure. Port Phillip’s Department of Sustainable Transport is a strong supporter of Back2Bikes.

Back2Bikes's charges for services, but at a level below for profit bike shops and provides free bikes to other charitable organisations, and bikes/servicing at further reduced pricing to healthcare card holders.

Back2Bikes’s mission is to provide bike training services, and bike recycling for the local community. It takes the form of a social enterprise, and does the following:

- Provides training for volunteers

- Provides training courses in bike maintenance

- Accepts bike donations for recycling

- Provides affordable bike servicing

- Recycles bikes as affordable transport

- Provides bikes for people with special needs

- Provides bikes for needy people

---

## <a id="2"></a>What is your client’s need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?
**[Home](#contents)** 

- Back2Bikes's current method for evaluating customers' bikes for repair or recycling is through a paper form that is stored physically. This requires physical storage and the information on it is difficult to access to find replacement parts. It takes staff time to add up individual prices for replacements parts. Job tracking is difficult.

- We need to do a thorough assessment of the bike when the customer brings it in.

- By doing this, we can accurately determine what needs to be done, and how much it will cost.

- Often the cost of repairs is more than the bike is worth. Knowing the cost ahead of time allows us to have a conversation with the customer about a go/no-go decision while they are still on the premises.



---
## <a id="3"></a>Describe the client’s current setup and data.
**[Home](#contents)** 

- Client's current setup is to use a paper form for bike repair assessment
- The paper form is recycled once a job is complete.
- The data collected on the paper form is not kept or stored anywhere once a job is completed and they cannot review previous jobs they may have completed.
- The price for a bike repair/service is estimated by the assessor (added on the one of 2 base prices, $60 for minor service and $120 for major service)

---

## <a id="4"></a>Describe the project you will be conducting and how your App will address the client’s needs.
**[Home](#contents)**

- A wizard which leads you through recording what needs to be done on the bike.
- A simple checklist guides you to check each part of the bike, and you tick a box to say what needs to be fixed (eg replace/service/nothing)
- It keeps track of the cost as you go, and once it gets to a certain price it may warn that the cost is getting high (might be useful to nter the value of the bike up front)
- At the end it provides a review of the items to be fixed, and allows the list to be edited (if some items are not to be fixed).

---
## <a id="5"></a>Identify and describe the software (including databases) to be used in yourApp.
**[Home](#contents)**

We will use the software below for our app:

- React
- Javascript
- Semantic UI
- MongoDB
- Meteor
- Trello
- Git
- Storybook
- Storyshots
- Circle Continuous Integration
- Nuclino

Some of the software we have never used before but it's what the client is using and we need to learn and adapt to their needs & deliver a valuable solution.

---
## <a id="51"></a>Identify and describe the network setup you will use in your development.
**[Home](#contents)**

Our network setup for this particular is as follows: 

The front end is in React JS, a component orientated JS framework which connects to the backend via http requests.

The backend is written in Meteor which connects to a MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database and is deployed using Meteor Up, Docker and a AWS Server.

All data is served using JSON to keep things consistent, efficient and modern.

---
## <a id="52"></a>Identify and describe the infrastructure (i.e. hardware) that your App will run on.
**[Home](#contents)**

Our application will be cross-platform running on laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. As our app will be exclusively used in a workshop so it was important that it be able to run on many different devices.

Our hosting and database is with 3rd party providers (Digital Ocean, MongoDB) that have hardware infrastructure spread around the globe.


---

## <a id="6"></a>Describe the architecture of your App.
**[Home](#contents)**

The architecture of our app consists of:

- Full-stack: Meteor
- - Front-end: React
- - Back-end: Meteor
- Database: MongoDB
- Hosting: Digital Ocean

Our client Back2Bikes had already developed an app prior to our arrival, so our architecture choice had already been decided. Luckily, the stack they are using is one we are mostly familiar with (with the only exception being the Meteor Framework). Our apps backend is running on Meteor with a MongoDB database. It is using React on the front end with the Semantic UI library used for our styles. This is inline with the client's existing setup for both development and design purposes.

---
## <a id="7"></a>Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.
**[Home](#contents)**

Our app consists of 8 high-level components. They are:

- Display-user component
- Admin Panel component
- Service Selector Component
- Bike assessment component
- Bike assessment review component
- Customer details component
- Confirmation component
- Current bike jobs component

From these higher level components there will be many sub components that make up each individual feature. 

---

## <a id="71"></a>Detail any third party services that your App will use.
**[Home](#contents)**
## 

Almost the entirety of our application is build from 3rd party services. All languages, frameworks and tools and sourced from a 3rd party. However, there are a few that stand out from the rest. They are: 

- Digital Ocean - A hosting provider for us to deploy our application

- MongoDB Atlas - A cloud database for our application

As well as the above to services we will also be using 

- React JS 
- React Router
- Meteor
- Meteor Up 
- Bcrypt
- Simpl-schema
- Storybook
- Jest
- Mocha 
- React-JSONschema-Form-Semanticui

---
## <a id="8"></a>Identify the database to be used in your app and provide a justification for your choice.
**[Home](#contents)**

As we are using Meteor for our project, MongoDB is the default database we will be using. This suits our needs because MongoDB is:

- Moves when you scale - modern db 

- Is very easy for rapid development 

- Additional collections & documents can be added without heavy mapping in advance

- The structure is a single object which is very clear for on-boarding team members.

- There are no complex joins

- Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.

- Document Oriented Storage − Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents.

- Index on any attribute

- Replication and high availability

- Auto-sharding

- Fast in-place updates

- Professional support by MongoDB is very good

---
## <a id="9"></a>Discuss the database relations to be implemented.
**[Home](#contents)**

MongoDB is not a relational database,  so we will not be using database relations.

For this specific app we will only have one relationship between collections. It will be between the assessment & repair-pricing collections. This enables us to have a collection of parts & pricing that will populate the assessment collection on a query if need be. 

One of the great things about MongoDB is it is very easy to enable a relationship and populate the data on a specific query. This enables fast dynamic development over drawn-out planning sessions.

---
## <a id="10"></a>Provide your database schema design.
**[Home](#contents)**

Database Type: No-SQL Database <br>
Database Engine: In-built MongoDB in Meteor <br>
Database Server: TBC

## Schema
The database will consists of 2 collections:

 - "assessment" - it will store all the information for bike assessment
 - "repair-pricing" - it will store all the pricing information of the repair services and parts

See below the database schema that we mocked up using JSON:

****

---
## <a id="11"></a>Provide User stories for your App.
**[Home](#contents)**

Our user stories are spilt into two parts.

- The assessors needs 
- The customers needs 

![Photo of the assessors user storeis](assets/accessor-user-stories-prt1.png)
![Photo of the assessors user storeis](assets/accessor-user-stories-prt2.png)
![Photo of customers user storeis](assets/customer-user-stories.png)

---

## <a id="12"></a>Provide Wireframes for your App.
**[Home](#contents)**

Coming into a pre existing codebase for the non for profit Back To Bikes we had to addapt to their stack as well as their current designs. We made sure that all the components we designed would be large, as many members of staff at Back2Bikes are older and don't have the best vision.

This is the initial style of the attendance app that we had to align with

![Photo of existing attendence design](assets/attendee-home.png)

We created a basic Figma user flow to give to our client for review. Shown below: 

![Photo of first user flow](assets/user-flow-1st.png)

After feedback from our client, we created the first design. Shown below:

![Photo of first user flow](assets/design-1st.png)

After another round of feedback, we created our client confirmed design. Shown below:

![Photo of first user flow](assets/design-2nd.png)

## <a id="13"></a>Describe the way Tasks are being allocated and tracked in your project.
**[Home](#contents)**

Before anything else, our team got together and decided on the outcomes as well as the standards that we wanted to live by. This will help us keep on track and keep each other accountable. 

Here is our team outcome and standards: 
## Team Outcome

- Deliver a valuable MVP and learn as much as possible

- Richard - Wanting to sharpen up on databases design, access & React.

- Jess - Wanting to hone her CSS & design skills

- Chris - Wanting to focus on React & Meteor

- AJ - Wanting to focus on React, Redux & Meteor

## Team Standards

- Arrive and be ready for a 10am standup

- Lunch is from 1pm - 2pm

- Finish at 5pm ... for now 

- Each Friday we pick a new task or already have one & we get done what we get done over the weekend

 - Over communicate! 

 - No pull requests or Gitting on weekend

The tasks are being allocated and tracked on a Agile style Trello board after the breakdown of the clients needs. The board is broken down into an agile workflow structure as follows:

Backlog

- These are items that need to be done, but perhaps they depend on something likeIt depends on another card being completed first You have not worked out the details of how to do it

- It's not in the current sprint, or it's not a high priority

Ready

- These are items that are ready to go, and have details filled in on the card. Create a checklist of the things that you need to do. (This card has an example of a checklist)Cards here won't usually won't have a name on them yet

In progress

- When you start a task, move the card into "In Progress" and put your name on it. It's best to only have one card each in this list - make it a habit to complete a task before grabbing another one

Dev done

- When you have completed work on the task, create a pull request, update the changelog, and move it to "Dev Done".

- Someone other than the dev should review the Pull Request for code quality, ask for changes if needed, and finally approve and merge it

- When the PR is merged, it will be moved into QA for someone to test it.

QA (Quality Assurance)

- All items should be tested in the staging environment by someone other than the person who did the work. Someone else will test it differently, and that perspective is useful.

Done

- We move cards to done after it has been through all of the steps above. There are some exceptions, but all development cards will need to go through the process.

- The tasks are allocated based on our teams strengths, eagerness to take on certain tasks , and allowing team members to learn the most from each other and this project as possible.

- The Development  tasks will be broken down in Sprint planning to ensure we have enough time to complete the different parts of the project.

---

## <a id="14"></a>Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your App.
**[Home](#contents)**

- Daily standups are being used to check in with everyone each day and help resolve the teams blockers.

- Sprints - We are working on a one week sprint cycle. This allows us to prioritise our most important work in earlier sprints and leave the stretch goals for later sprints.

- Retrospectives - After each sprint we have a short retrospective to look at what went right and what went wrong so we are able to adjust our behaviour for future sprints and ideally improve productivity.

- Trello  is being used as our Kanban board to pass tickets back and forth through various points of the development cycle. A team member is assigned a ticket and it is their responsibility to see it through to completion (with the assistance of other team members as required.)

---

## <a id="141"></a>Provide an overview and description of your Source control process.
**[Home](#contents)**

For source control we will be using git through github.com. 

As we are coming on to an existing project, we are working off a development branch that has been split from the the main project. In the development branch , each of the members of  our team will create their own branch in which to develop the piece of work they have been assigned. After completion and review of the team members work, they will then push their branch up into github. Once in github the code will be reviewed by the project managers and merged into the development branch via an accepted pull request. 

Each new day we will 'git pull' off the master "development" branch so that we are always working off an up to date code base. 

---
## <a id="15"></a>Provide an overview and description of your Testing process
**[Home](#contents)**

- Jest & Mocha will be used as our  testing software for this project.

- Test Driven Development (TDD) is essential and we will be adhering to this standard for our project.

- Testing will be done manually

- While we project that the amount of code in our project  will not be too onerous, we are following the TDD methodology so that we embed good practices in our team members from the get-go.

- We will be writing tests first to ensure that we know what we are aiming for before we begin development.  We will run the tests frequently during the development process.

- Storybook and Storyshots will also be used to test out the appearance and function of different components during the development process.

---
## <a id="15"></a>Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security
**[Home](#contents)**

In any application where you are gathering user information it is important to make sure that data is accurate, safely stored, and accessible only to authorised users.

At a minimum our customers expect that we:

- Do not use their data for any purpose other than the reason they provided it (to allow us to link their bike repair to them).

- That customer data is safely stored and cannot be accessed by non-related parties to Back2Bikes that may have detrimental reasons for wanting the data.

- That customer data can only be accessed by Back2Bike users that have the appropriate permissions within the app.

---
## <a id="16"></a>Discuss methods you will use to protect information and data.
**[Home](#contents)**

Our approach to user information security fall under these 3 categories

Authentication

- In order to ensure the user's who are on our app are who we expect them to be, we have implemented user pins and passwords to login with your account.

Authorisation

- User's on our app are assigned different roles depending upon their status within the organisation. Only users with managerial roles are able to access customer details, volunteer information, and other sensitive data.

Validation

- All routes are protect using Jason Web Tokens that are 64bit encrypted and salted 

Passwords

- All passwords will be hashed before being saving into the database so there is never a plain text password available to be taken.

---
## <a id="17"></a>Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data.
**[Home](#contents)**

We investigated our legal obligations towards our customer using Google, and came across this page posted by the Australian Government. (https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/guides/guide-to-securing-personal-information)

In this link we found that while it is extremely important to protect customer data, the effort made to protect data should be tempered by the potential harm that can occur from customer data being stolen. As we are only storing data that is publicly available for most people (name & email address), we didn't need to slow down our work process too much in order to secure it. We will be following simple Authentication, Authorisation, and data validation standards for our project.

## <a id="20"></a> Plan information gathering activities to determine project requirements,constraints and risks
**[Home](#contents)** 

We met with our client at their premises and were taken through their current method of assessing bikes, recording their assessments, and estimating the cost of assessment. From this we developed a set of project requirements which were sent through to our client to make sure they met his needs. After his feedback, we adjusted the requirements and they were approved. Proper sprint planning and development then began.

## <a id="21"></a> Develop project charter, including preliminary statement of project scope and obtain sign-off
**[Home](#contents)** 

See Part A Sections - Who is your client, Describe the project you will be conducting and how your App will address the client's needs.

## <a id="22"></a> Prepare project work breakdown and schedule
**[Home](#contents)**

**[Provide your database schema design.](#10)**

**[Provide Wireframes for your App.](#12)**

**[Describe the way Tasks are being allocated and tracked in your project.](#13)**

## <a id="23"></a> Allocate roles and responsibilities to team members, based on project solution requirements
**[Home](#contents)** 

Due to the small size of our team, people were involved in lots of different areas. Where required we had members with more knowledge in areas assist others with development tasks. Each morning we had a stand up and discussed what each team member would be working on for that day.

## <a id="24"></a> Monitor each other’s assigned work
**[Home](#contents)** 

As we were using Trello, we could all see where various tickets were and comment or assist as needed. We also had a retrospective at the end of each week to discuss how we were all going with our assigned tasks.

## <a id="25"></a> Reassess ongoing project scope changes, risks and issues
**[Home](#contents)** 

Throughout the development of the app we were in frequent communication with our client. As the client was involved as the QA when we were merging our branches into development, he always had a good overview on our current progress. Upon developing certain components of our app, we would be informed that he would prefer a different layout or slightly different functional experience. We would then take this feedback on board and where reasonable and achievable would make it happen.

## <a id="26"></a> Manage system testing and hand over activities. Prepare maintenance or support plans for client.
**[Home](#contents)** 

As our app was basically two new features for an existing application, our handover needs are relatively minimal. Our client is an experienced developer with the knowledge and expertise needed to resolve any potential issues that may occur over the app's life-cycle. When building the app we made sure to adhere to existing design patterns and any other guidelines provided by the client to ensure their would be no surprises down the line when/if they need to make changes.

## <a id="27"></a> Obtain final project sign-off
**[Home](#contents)** 
Project was queried and approved by Ruegen, Matt, and Gretchen.

## <a id="28"></a> Post Project Review
**[Home](#contents)** 

Working as part of a 4 person team exposed us all to development challenges that we had not previously experienced. While it was easy for us to each indiviudally manage our own time on previous projects, the scope of work and needs of the team meant that good communication and effective collaboration was an early problem we needed to navigate in order to work productively. As in any team, different members had different strengths, weaknesses, & skills and splitting the work in a way to be both fair and provide everyone the oppuotunity to push themselves was important. WE found that we worked very well together and kept up high spirits during this project.

A point of weakness was we sometimes forgot to update Trello cards or move them as work was completed. This would mean that other team members might lose visibility on where the project was at and what a good next step for them would be.

## <a id="29"></a> Create a questionnaire for the client to ascertain the satisfaction with your products and services
**[Home](#contents)** 

- Has the new app solved your business problem?
- Are there any features missing that you would have liked to be included?
- How was the communication of the team?
- Was enough effort made to ensure that what they were developing matched what you needed?
- Were there any issues you had in collaborating with the development team?
- What feedback would you provide to the team for future projects?

## <a id="37"></a> Project plan and effort estimation
**[Home](#contents)** 

We used a Trello board for our project planning and planned sprints each week to get through the work. We did not use story points for our estimates as the concept proved to be more confusing than useful, so we did daily standups each morning to gauge where we are at and how our development pace was going.

#  5.3 Tools & Methodologie

## <a id="39"></a> Demonstrate your project management skills
**[Home](#contents)** 

Our project was a new feature to an existing app that was also having features added by another team. This required us to have good communication not only with out client but also the other team and their stakeholders. Despite these difficulties, we successfully ran 2 sprints and got our feature up and running in time for extra testing.

Our team would often work doing pair programming which allowed for a two person review process to be occurrring on most development. As we only had a limited number of manhours and a tight deadline to meet, we considered this a sufficient effort to review our code.

## <a id="44"></a> Client Communication
**[Home](#contents)** 

Slack was our primary means of communication as well as some emails for lengthier information transfers.
As a whole we enjoyed and apprecaited a real life experience of what it's like working with a client. It's very different to working on your own and making all your own decisions. Here is an exaple of some of the emails that went back and forth to make sure we were buidling something of utmost use.
